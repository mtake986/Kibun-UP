## üí¨ Abstract

This is an app to have users to keep their motivation to a specific target which users can set. I love the greatest quotes in the world and often read them to inspire myself to the target.

By the way, I created the appp name, "Kibun UP". I have been a college student in the U.S. since 2019. "Kibun" is a Japanese word means feeling or mood, and the sound likes 7 UP, a famous soda in the U.S. and "UP" is an English word.

Also, quotes that the login user bookmarked and quotes that the login user liked are displayed under the **Bookmarks** and **Likes** tabs.
