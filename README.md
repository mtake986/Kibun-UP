<h1 align="center">Kibun UP</h1>

<p align="center">This is an app to have users to keep their motivation to a specific target which users can set. I love the greatest quotes in the world and often read them to inspire myself to the target.</p>
<p align="center">By the way, I created the appp name, "Kibun UP". I have been a college student in the U.S. since 2019. "Kibun" is a Japanese word means feeling or mood, and the sound likes 7 UP, a famous soda in the U.S. and "UP" is an English word. </p>

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `"npm run dev`

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

## Built With
